#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Amanda and Rosie paired together. It took about 2 hours

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
 1. First, we started on doing all of the TODOS! The second was pretty easy, while the first one was quite difficult as we had to set up a lot more for a windows machine than a mac.
 2. Next, we completed all of the comments.
 3. Finally, we worked through some of the review items that we had trouble understanding the first time around.
